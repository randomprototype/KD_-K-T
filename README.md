**Cost-Rate Computation for "An aperiodic inspection and replacement policy based on the delay-time model with component-lifetime heterogeneity"**

Welcome to the source code for our Streamlit app. This application computes the cost-rate for a hybrid inspection and age-based maintenance policy, which considers aperiodic inspections and heterogeneous component lifetimes, which was developed by Victor H. R. Lima, Rafael. G. N. Paiva, Augusto J. S. Rodrigues, Hanser S. J. Gonz√°lez and Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante.

This web-app is designed to aid maintenance decision-makers by highlightinh the importance of determining optimal moments for every action.
